🌌 Sheychx-Dynamics | Project: "The Last Signal"
Vertical Slice V.2.1.0 is officially Live. We’ve hit our major milestone. THL is no longer just a prototype—it’s the production-ready backbone for our upcoming title.

Lead Architect: Scheych Mansur Burajev

Tech Stack: Unreal Engine | Dedicated SM5 Pipeline

🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE
We built Sheychx-Dynamics to handle the transition from raw logic to massive, industrial-grade environments. It’s about stability at scale.

2,100 Packages: Successfully stress-tested and verified at peak capacity.

Performance First: By sticking to a dedicated SM5 pipeline, we’ve ensured that the game runs smooth across a wide hardware spectrum (Optimized for RTX 2070 / i7-8750H) without losing that high-end visual punch.

🎮 PROJECT: "THE LAST SIGNAL"
Imagine a high-tier vertical mobility experience set in a world where Eldritch horror meets Industrial brutalism.

Movement & AI: We’ve finalized the state-based AI and our core vertical movement mechanics.

Immersion: Featuring fully diegetic UI systems—no floating menus, just pure interaction (Trophy/Wrench/Key).

The Hub: Our 3D-Lobby for class visualization (Sprinter/Heavy) is now fully integrated and stable.

📅 THE ROADMAP
